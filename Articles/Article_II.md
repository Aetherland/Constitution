## Article II. General Provisions
The General Provisions set forth the fundamental values, language, territorial principles, and other defining elements and symbols of the Sovereign Order of Aether.

 1. The nation is officially designated as the Sovereign Order of Aether. Acceptable alternative short names include Aether Nation and Aetherland. Other alternative names are not recognized for use. Nationals of the Sovereign Order of Aether bear the official demonym of Aether.
 2. The Sovereign Order of Aether is a secular state, maintaining a strict separation of church and State. Government activities shall never be conducted based on religious grounds, including but not limited to laws rooted in religion, the incorporation of religion into politics, and interference by religious organizations in governmental affairs.
 3. English is recognized as the official language of the Sovereign Order of Aether. Although English is the sole language employed for all government activities, it is not obligatory for citizens and residents to speak it. However, individuals seeking public office must demonstrate proficient English speaking skills or possess effective means of translation from their native language.
 4. Embracing a nomadic ethos, the Sovereign Order of Aether makes no territorial claims, encouraging its people to inhabit all corners of the Earth and beyond, and to perpetually explore. Nevertheless, citizenship or residency within the Aether Nation does not absolve individuals of their obligations to local governments in foreign states. Aether citizens and residents must abide by the laws of both the Sovereign Order of Aether and the foreign state in which they physically reside.
 5. The Sovereign Order of Aether acknowledges the Human Era Calendar, also known as the Holocene Calendar, as the exclusive official calendar of the State. Greenwich Mean Time serves as the recognized time zone for all governmental communications. The Aether Nation adopts the metric system as the sole system for unit measurements.
 6. Various national symbols represent the Aether Nation, including the national colors of Royal Blue, Black, and White. The national animal is the Dragon, the official motto is "Ad Astra Et Ultra," and the official classical element is aether. The flag of the Aether Nation features a black field with a 3:5 aspect ratio, displaying two white intersecting hexagons at the center, with one rotated 90Â° from its original position.
